# Cuberoll
Cuberoll is a casual game made with Unity where you control a cube that has colors on each of it's side

Obstacles will start moving towards your cube and you have to match the color that is facing the obstacles with the obstacle's color

When you the obstacle reach your cube and its the same color then you will get +1 on your score, try to reach for a high score!

If it isn't the same color then you will lose a life, you have 3. If you lose all of them then its game over.

Have fun!
